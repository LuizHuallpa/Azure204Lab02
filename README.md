# AZ 204 Labs - Lab 02: Implement task processing logic by using Azure Functions

First we create all the resources we need inside Azure. After that we created a basic function that echoes the content sent through an HTTP POST request.
Then we created a function that returns the content of a JSON file in Storage. After all of that is done we deployed a local function project to Azure Functions and validated that the functions work in Azure.
